 Find the minimum number of operations required to reach target from start.

Working backward from target is more efficient:

If target is even, you came from target // 2

If target is odd, you came from target - 1

def min_operations(start, target):
    operations = 0
    while target > start:
        if target % 2 == 0:
            target //= 2
        else:
            target += 1  # because (odd number -1) will make it even
        operations += 1
    return operations + (start - target)
