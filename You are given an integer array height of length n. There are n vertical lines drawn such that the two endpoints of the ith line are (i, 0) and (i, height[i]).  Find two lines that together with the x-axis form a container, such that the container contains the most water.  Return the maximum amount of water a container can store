You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxarea = 0
        left,right=0,len(height)-1

        while left<right:
            width = right-left
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * width
            maxarea = max(maxarea,area)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left= left +1
            else:
                right = right -1
        return maxarea
