###write a program in python to calculate the number of days to mine an asteroid if such that there is one robot at the beginning of the day and each roboto gets cloned every day. 
##The cloned robot will decide whether to mine on that day or not 
import math

def min_days_to_mine_with_clone_cost(n):
    min_days = float('inf')

    # Try cloning for 0 to 60 days
    for clone_days in range(0, 61):
        robots = 1
        total = 0
        for _ in range(clone_days):
            # All robots clone: double count
            robots *= 2
        # After clone_days, use all robots to mine
        mining_days = math.ceil(n / robots)
        total_days = clone_days + mining_days
        min_days = min(min_days, total_days)
    return min_days
