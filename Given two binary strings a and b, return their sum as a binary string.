Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        i = len(a) - 1  # pointer to the end of string a
        j = len(b) - 1  # pointer to the end of string b
        carry = 0       # initialize carry to 0
        result = []     # this will hold the final binary sum in reverse

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            total = carry  # start with carry from previous step

            if i >= 0:
                total += int(a[i])  # add the digit from a
                i -= 1
            if j >= 0:
                total += int(b[j])  # add the digit from b
                j -= 1

            result.append(str(total % 2))  # store current bit
            carry = total // 2             # update carry for next step

        return "".join(reversed(result))  # reverse the result to get correct order
