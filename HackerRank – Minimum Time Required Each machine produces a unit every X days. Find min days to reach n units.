HackerRank â€“ Minimum Time Required
Each machine produces a unit every X days. Find min days to reach n units.

def minTime(machines, goal):
    # Search range: min and max production rate bounds
    low = 1
    high = max(machines) * goal  # worst case

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        total = sum(mid // m for m in machines)
        
        if total >= goal:
            high = mid  # try smaller day
        else:
            low = mid + 1  # need more days

    return low
machines = [2,5,6]
goal = 10
