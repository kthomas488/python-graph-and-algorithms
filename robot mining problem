Robot Cloning Mining Problem
1. Start with 1 robot
2. Each day, a robot can either mine 1 unit or clone itself (takes the whole day).
3. Goal: mine n units in minimum number of days.

import math

def min_days_to_mine_with_clone_cost(n):
    min_days = float('inf')

    # Try cloning for 0 to 60 days
    for clone_days in range(0, 61):
        robots = 1
        total = 0
        for _ in range(clone_days):
            # All robots clone: double count
            robots *= 2
        # After clone_days, use all robots to mine
        mining_days = math.ceil(n / robots)
        total_days = clone_days + mining_days
        min_days = min(min_days, total_days)
    return min_days
