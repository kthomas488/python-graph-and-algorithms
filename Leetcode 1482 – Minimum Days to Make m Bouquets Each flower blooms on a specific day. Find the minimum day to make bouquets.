Leetcode 1482 â€“ Minimum Days to Make m Bouquets
Each flower blooms on a specific day. Find the minimum day to make bouquets.
def canMake(bloomDay, m, k, days):
    bouquets = 0
    flowers = 0
    for bloom in bloomDay:
        if bloom <= days:
            flowers += 1
            if flowers == k:
                bouquets += 1
                flowers = 0
        else:
            flowers = 0
    return bouquets >= m

def minDays(bloomDay, m, k):
    if len(bloomDay) < m * k:
        return -1  # Not enough flowers
    
    low = min(bloomDay)
    high = max(bloomDay)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canMake(bloomDay, m, k, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low
